# KIIP

Kiip is a user-friendly web application, that uses Angular to power its front-end, and Java Spring Boot to run the backend.

Kiip is designed to save your time from searching around for the same code snippet you found some minutes ago. It is user-friendly and it allows developers to store and retrieve useful code snippets, like snippets from Stack Overflow or from their own projects. It is simple, easy to use, and provides powerful search capabilities for developers. 

This allows easy access to these code snippets so that you can have them right at hand as you are programming. You can even assign tags to each snippet allowing them to be easily found when needed!

Its UI is powered by a Creative-Tim Argon template and as such Kiip is open source and MIT licensed.
